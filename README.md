# WigLang Interpreter

This is a pseudo compiler built in a weekend for the class Programming Language Fundamentals.

The main purpose of this tool is to create a run time stack analysis for a toy language that's based off of the B programming language.

To compile this you can simply pull the repository and run `python main.py`. There are a couple of example files for what the language looks like.

Currently the runtime compiler recognizes conditional statements, assignment, declaration, functions, recursion, and several other basic functions.
